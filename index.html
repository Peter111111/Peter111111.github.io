		<h1>My Studing in the Chernivtsi University</h1>
		<h3>During my studies in Chernivtsi, I acquired a huge amount of skills, knowledge and friends. These 6 years will forever remain in my memory as the happiest years of my life.<br> Since my freshman year I have been living in a student hostel where I got the skills for survival. Over the years of studying the exact Sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and related topics, I have come to the conclusion that everything is really relative.<br> I realized how important it is to understand what diffraction, interference and dispersion are, because these are some of the basic principles of building an optical system. Delving into the study of optics comes the understanding that everything in the world is tied to optics, Northern lights, eclipses and other natural phenomena are very important for the ability to predict weather and other climate changes. Optics is also important in weapons to create accurate optical sights, thermal imagers and in medicine.<br> Today, our University can provide all the necessary knowledge in the field of opto-technology to ensure quality and educated personnel of the enterprise and design offices. To date, there are ingenious developments that in the near future will increase the speed of information transmission several times due to some optical properties.<br>Thanks to the knowledge gained, I work in the field of software development that helps to make the world a better place! After receiving a bachelor's degree, I decided to continue my studies in the master's program, to improve skills and gain in-depth knowledge. In the future, I want to continue to develop in the field of optical systems.</h3>
